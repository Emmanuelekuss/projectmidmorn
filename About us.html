    <h3>UZIMA SANCTUARY</h3>
    <P>Just an hours's drive from the city, the Uzima Sanctuary is private land adjoining the Nairobi National Park, a rich landscape of rolling plains situated between the deep gorges of the Embakasi & Kiserian rivers. The Sanctuary is an ideal location to get away from the city without travelling distances & sacrificing time & expense. Four hundred acres of private land, this periurban oasis is home to 60 species of mammal, species of birds & a rich diversity of flora reflecting the various habitats (riverine forest, grassland plain & valley thicket) found within it.

        Things to do in the Sanctuary include walking (with or without guides), swimming
        at the Masai Lodge pool, rock climbing in the rocky river gorges, bird-watching and of
        course, game-driving in the Nairobi National Park, which is accessible through the Masai Gate, which opens on to
        the Sanctuary.</P></div>

        <h3>Some directions</h3>
        <p>How to get here: The best way to get to the Sanctuary is through the Masai Gate (south end of the Park; follow the signs). Otherwise drive down the Magadi Road from Bomas of Kenya on the Langata road & turn first left off the tarmac (signboarded to Nazarene University & Masai Lodge). Then just keep going to the end of the murram road (6 km) until you reach Masai Lodge.

            The turn off to Silole Villa & Silole Cottage is on the right immediately before the Masai Lodge Gate.

            In the dry season, the roads are fine, but during the Rains you might like to use a 4 WD vehicle to get
            to the Sanctuary and/or the Park.</p>
